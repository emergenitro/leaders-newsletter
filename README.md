# Club Leader Updates

Every Friday afternoon, I send a newsletter called "The Hackening" to all active club leaders. I also post the same update in #leaders in Slack. These updates contain current events and ways for clubs and club leaders to engage in or contribute to the community. This repo will contain every newsletter I've sent to club leaders.

If you want to be included in future updates, email me (holly@hackclub.com) or DM me on Slack! (@holly). You can also subscribe [here](https://airtable.com/shrehIGl77kf2cSPZ)
