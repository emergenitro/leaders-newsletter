# Club Leader Updates

~~Every Friday afternoon, I send a newsletter called "The Hackening" to all active club leaders. I also post the same update in [#leaders](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C02PA5G01ND) in Slack. These updates contain current events and ways for clubs and club leaders to engage in or contribute to the community. This repo will contain every newsletter I've sent to club leaders.~~

Come join #newsletter in the Hack Club Slack to learn more about this!
