### 🕵️🐴 Stable Quarters Equine Center: A Hack Club Mystery

Clubs around the world are trying to crack the Hack Club ARG and yet❓ **it remains unsolved!** ❓ Join them in [#stable-quarters](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C04JY7KPP34) on Slack!
* [Thomas](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U041FQB8VK2) introduced it to his club last week *"... Everyone contributed toward our shared goal, solving the ARG! The excitement in the room when a discovery was made (such as when we hacked into the cameras) brought us much joy & we are going to continue working together to solve the puzzle!"*
* [Valerii](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U04AQ63DBHQ)'s club put up posters around school to get new people involved!
