### 🔴🟠🟡🟢🔵🟣

[Matthew](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U4QAK9SRW) shipped [Technicolor](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0M8PUPU6/p1678826348314959), an honest and inspiring write-up about his time as a club leader then as the Clubs Lead at HQ. In particular, I love how he overcame some common club challenges in really creative ways (🦸 a sticker cape, for example)

I find new insights every time I read it and I recommend all of you read it too - it's totally worth it 💖

### 📹 The Epoch documentary dropped!
On December 30th 2022, 160 hackers from around the world traveled to the 🇮🇳 Delhi, NCR for Epoch — a 42-hour high-school hackathon over New Year's. 🎆 It was a magical weekend and [sam](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/USNPNJXNX) just [shipped](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0M8PUPU6/p1678724243206549) the [documentary](https://youtu.be/KLx4NZZPzMc) that shows you how it all came together. Sam, I'm glad you survived!

🎧 Recently, I've been re-listening to [Mac Miller](https://open.spotify.com/artist/4LLpKhyESsyAXpc4laK94U?si=Dw0gdHgLSD2ihflfxqwb_w)'s last two albums, [Swimming](https://open.spotify.com/album/5wtE5aLX5r7jOosmPhJhhk?si=7MUeVHUZR1uFSqHNPzZ_JQ) and [Circles](https://open.spotify.com/album/5sY6UIQ32GqwMLAfSNEaXb?si=2Ng0NAYaRYqthoviIifDjw). While Mac's older music had a party vibe, he developed a really intimate story-telling style in his more recent work 🎵
