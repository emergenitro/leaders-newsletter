## 👋 It's [Holly](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03M1H014CX) here with the current awesome things you and your club can get involved in! 💫Check out past editions [here](https://workshops.hackclub.com/leader-newsletters/).

*(You're getting this email because you lead a Hack Club. [Your whole club can get it too!](https://airtable.com/shrehIGl77kf2cSPZ))*

### Scrapbook for your club 🙌
Ever wanted a portfolio of all your club's projects? Thanks to [Sam](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/USNPNJXNX) and team, now you can create a Scrapbook profile for your club entirely from the web! This gives your members a space to share what they’re creating in your club with the world. Everyone can react to posts just like in [#scrapbook](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD), even if your members aren't in Slack!

Head to [Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/) to create your club page! Custom domains & CSS are supported (these pages would make for sick club websites!)

*Scrapbook v2 is in beta at the moment, so bugs are expected, please let us know in [#scrapbook-dev](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C035D6S6TFW) on Slack. 👀 **Watch for an exciting tie-in coming soon**!*

### 🎨 Draw something
I've been watching some cool *things* come together on the [drawing machine project](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C04GCH8A91D) that [Leo](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U022FMN61SB), [Ella](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U01D6FYHLUW) and team have been working on. This week, they added a [TODO list](https://github.com/hackclub/drawing-thing/blob/main/TODO.md) which you should check out. After that, ✨ **take a look at the [issues](https://github.com/hackclub/drawing-thing/issues/) for opportunities to contribute to the project**✨ 

Specifically, [this issue](https://github.com/hackclub/drawing-thing/issues/11) asks for generative art contributions (it'd even make a really good club meeting 👀). See [this workshop](https://workshops.hackclub.com/tree_machine/) if you need a way to get started 🌈

### ❇️ Club workshop highlight ❇
[Aditya](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03BMEJRFT4) and [Pranav](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03RY8FP4RW) recently ran a workshop on 
cybersecurity/cryptology that I thought was really cool. They gave me permission to share it so you can hack on it and try in your own club meetings! 

⭐ [Meeting ppt.pdf](https://github.com/hackclub/leaders-newsletter/files/11124672/Untitled.presentation.pdf) ⭐ [Decode.pdf](https://github.com/hackclub/leaders-newsletter/files/11124669/DECODE.pdf)
 ⭐ [Decode Answers.pdf](https://github.com/hackclub/leaders-newsletter/files/11124668/DECODE.ANSWERS.pdf)


➡️From Aditya: "Most people worked in small group of 2 to 3 and it took everyone the whole meeting to get the answer. Most of our members don't have a ton of prior experience with computer science and programming (I don't think any of them have anything related to cybersecurity before)." "...It could be more cyber security focused depending on the experience level of the club members. We gave candy to anyone who finished the puzzle..."⬅️

✨If you have a workshop idea you'd like to share, [DM me](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03M1H014CX)!✨



Till next time!

🎧 Recently, I've discovered [Ayoni](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2Tju7nLsAMD6RTBna56hj6?si=v_1v5LbWTeCriDMOLhG40w), who's music "...pushes the sonic boundaries by infusing [her] moody and ethreal pop sound with the beautiful adaptation of island soul." I'm especially fond of [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/6q4p2BhVOAEDJPeXpV2pkC?si=c004479a58164fea)🎵
