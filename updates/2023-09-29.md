### 🌲⛺ The Outernet video is live! 
Exactly 3 months ago, 150 teenagers came to Vermont for a magical weekend in the woods. I met some of you there for the very first time, and we painted a [canvas](https://cloud-le6r34w5b-hack-club-bot.vercel.app/0img20230929160249.jpg) that will hang in HQ forever. Now, [check out the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1s5HqSqKi0) that pulls it all together. Relive the moments, or feel like you were there, and I hope to see you at the next one! 🏕️🐄

🎵 [Sleep Token](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2n2RSaZqBuUUukhbLlpnE6?si=dkXqoQDETeCr2OQUESis-A) is a mysterious alternative rock/metal band I was recently recommended by a friend. They have a super unique sound and I find it hard to put them into any genre boxes. [This song](https://open.spotify.com/track/0B4YX3OMtZSmPm9KpiZKl2?si=f6a4132c4f7d4b05) is one of my favorites!  ✨ 🎧
