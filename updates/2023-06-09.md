### 🚀 Clubs Directory: Liftoff!
Collaborating with other clubs IRL just got way easier! [Arpan](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U0409FSKU82) and [Thomas]() built the new [Clubs Directory](https://clubsdirectory.vercel.app/) so you can find clubs near you, but now you can contact each other to plan in-person activities. 

*You have to [opt in](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/D05A9U9DXBQ) before any of your club contact info will be shared*

🎧 I've been listening to a lot of [Brandi Carlile](https://open.spotify.com/artist/2sG4zTOLvjKG1PSoOyf5Ej?si=wfwEYOfLSr-o4pUOIPTmsg)'s music over the last week or so. Not only is she a master of her craft, she's also the founder of the [Looking Out Foundation](https://www.lookingoutfoundation.org/) that funds causes to promote (among other things) equality for women and the LGBTQ+ community 🏳️‍🌈 🎵
