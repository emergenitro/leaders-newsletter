## 🍓🫐 We're Jammin' 🍇  
**This summer, join us to build the future of Hack Club meets - we're calling them [Jams](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C058T2CJUNR)!**

Work with the team at HQ to ship a Jam and 💸 **we'll pay you $200** 💸 for your 10-15 hour time commitment. Then, your Jam will be used by thousands of Hack Clubbers around the world!

A Jam is a real project that can be completed in under 1 hour and everyone's result is different! The goal is to build a quality project for varying technical abilities and will include slides and a video. 

### 🌈Here's how to get started
 
* *We're only accepting 20 Jams this round*
1. Propose a Jam by July 2! *Check the [README](https://github.com/hackclub/Jams/tree/main#readme) for instructions
3. Hear back from the team within 48 hours Mon-Fri on whether your proposal is accepted.
4. Once accepted, work closely with the team to write the Jam, make a presentation and film a short video by July 19.
5. Ka-ching💰🪙!
