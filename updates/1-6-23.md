🎧 I’ve recently been listening to [Amber Run](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0MmnmsAuQKRFpo6vJElcaU?si=ras7rBh-SX-4R-b4HP65lg), especially [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/5QPachkZsP2xHp52FIoX0d?si=cc4803bcbc844469). They're a really great indie band who's lead singer gives me Kit Harington vibes
