You're invited to create the hacker village of your dreams at [#outernet](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C054FA87K8C/p1684513601545379), an IRL hacker gathering happening this summer in VT! 
No society is complete without ✔️ [A community podcast](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C058PP60PFU) ✔️ [A hacker cafe](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C058MNEP9MZ) ✔️ or [A slightly suspicious phone network](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C058NM4HZCJ) amiright? These are some of the [guilds](https://github.com/hackclub/outernet) being organized by teen hackers so far, but there are so many more possibilities too! What do you want to guild?
