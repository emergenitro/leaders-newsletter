### Yeah, these builds are definitely 🔥!
🛠️ Teenagers from all over the world are working on [hundreds of hardware projects](https://winterlings.vercel.app/) as part of Hack Club's Winter Hardware Wonderland, and the building has begun! I'm seeing some really cool projects being started by club leaders in [#scrapbook](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD) this week:
* [Kai Zheng](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U049N5Y0WM9) is [3D printing](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1676424022819869) an enclosure for a [waterproof scale](https://github.com/hackclub/winter/blob/main/kaiz715.md) ⚖️
* [Linus](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U011CFN98K1) got his air quality sensor to [spit out data](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1676448041962199) for his [PlantPrint](https://github.com/hackclub/winter/blob/main/LinusSkucas.md) project! 🪴
* [Linkai's](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U01R8RSGYUV) making progress [through trial and error](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1676427496833869) on the housing for his [3D-printed split-flap display](https://github.com/hackclub/winter/blob/main/linkai101.md) 📇

Something else really cool is [DevIos](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U014E8132DB), [Kiana](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U04HL0F3WTA) and [Nahir Elio](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U04HXJMEUR1) working with [their whole club](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1676434655103329) to 3D print the zapper component of their [NES Duckhunt remake](https://github.com/hackclub/winter/blob/main/DevIos01%26Kiana.md) 🦆
 
 ✨Anyone else incorporating their WHW project into their club?

🎧 I've been listening to a lot of [Charlotte Day Wilson](https://open.spotify.com/artist/3GQboECxDT1xqPPWC30p7v?si=J4gD0na1T5WKuXVNIWWvnw), an R&B/soul singer from Toronto. I love her voice and [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/3SwN8BDBWTzaO2rCF0vZAR?si=7512fce2c3e542dc) in particular 🎵
