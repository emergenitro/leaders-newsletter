### 🍇🍓🫐 Just in time for the new clubs season: Introducing Hack Club Jams! 
**Bring your club on an epic adventure in code this semester!** [Jams](http://jams.hackclub.com/) are 18 brand new coding workshops created by Hack Clubbers ESPECIALLY for you to use in your meetings, *complete with pre-made slide decks and even some videos*! 

Take your club meetings to the next level with topics from [AI](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/ai-travel), [3D design](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/3d-club-village) and [Sprig](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/sprig) to [web dev](https://jams.hackclub.com/batch/webOS) and [game dev](https://jams.hackclub.com/jam/story-game). Plus we'll be adding more new Jams throughout the year! [Thomas](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U041FQB8VK2) says it best in his [#announcements post](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGT/p1692225982443919).
