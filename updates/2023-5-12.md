### Angelhacks 3.0 👼
I'm going to [Angelhacks 3.0](https://www.angelhacks.org/) in Boston for a **24hour game-jam-style hackathon on May 27 & 28** and I'd love to see you there too! Registrations are still open and there's something for everyone, even if making games isn't your jam. If you're not in the Boston area check out the 12-hour, IRL satellites happening in [Toronto](https://angelhacksto.hackclub.com/), and the [Bay Area](https://angelhacksba.hackclub.com/) on May 27th!

To sign up for the beta ✔️

### Leader meeting 📆
Summer is coming ☀️ here in VT. Does your club keep in touch over the summer or other school breaks? Whether you do already or you'd like to try, the next leader's meeting is for you! [JP](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/UN1PMGUN8) will be leading a discussion on summer(vacation) engagement for clubs on **Saturday May 20 at 8pm EST**

### Sinerider ❤️ + 🧮
Adorable ghosts, beautiful scenery and stunning mathematical equations - it all waits for you on [Sinerider](http://sinerider.com/)! Earlier this week an army of teenagers shipped the public beta so you can play it with your club or show your math teacher that playing video games can indeed be educational 😉 

🙌 🎉 **Congratulations and great work to the whole [#Sinerider](https://hackclub.slack.com/admin/user_groups) team!**

🏝️ I went on a trip in April. If you can guess where, I'll send you something special 🔍 *Here's a hint: It has a rugged coastline unreachable by car, but beloved by many a filmmaker 🎥.*
