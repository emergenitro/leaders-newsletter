🎧 I’ve recently been listening to [Amber Run](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0MmnmsAuQKRFpo6vJElcaU?si=ras7rBh-SX-4R-b4HP65lg), especially [this song](https://open.spotify.com/track/5QPachkZsP2xHp52FIoX0d?si=cc4803bcbc844469). They're a really great indie band who's lead singer gives me Kit Harington vibes

❓❕ *hmmmmm... I saw [this](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGV/p1670544403858819) the other day and I'm really curious what it means. Any guesses?*
