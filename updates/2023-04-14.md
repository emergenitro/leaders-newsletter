### 🌐 One VPN to rule them all
... Made by you! I've heard from so many leaders that blocked websites and school firewalls make it really hard to code in your clubs.  You can be part of the solution! Join [Conrad](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U0C7HD8V7) and many other teenagers to build the most amazing VPN to ever exist 💥 Check out this [intro post](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C0266FRGT/p1681138906883709), then head over to [#burrow](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C052HA0NE4T) to get involved. This is going to be epic!

### 🤝 (Re)Introducing Scrapbook!

[Scrapbook](https://scrapbook.hackclub.com/) was created by Hack Clubbers as a place to post pictures or updates on projects you're working on so the community can see. [Here's a really good example post](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01504DCLVD/p1681339672890139)

Now, you can sign in and create a custom scrapbook page for your club so your members can post project updates to *right from the web*, since they might not be in Slack (custom CSS and such is available too!) That way, when you're all working on projects, you can keep track of everyone's progress. It's kind of like your own club-specific portfolio page.

⭐I made some pins from [Lucas Honda](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U040N4ESCEL)'s favorite Sprig sprites, and I liked them so much that I want to make more! I'll mail a set of custom pins to **The first 20 people** to [DM me](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03M1H014CX) their own unique sprite designs!⭐
