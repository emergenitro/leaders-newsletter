### Playtest with your club🧪
Mix up a club meeting by introducing playtesting! Playtesting is an integral part of software development that gives the teams a chance to really see the current builds, discover bugs and provide feedback. **Hack Club has two projects that are perfect for playtesting:** Play together, then open the floor for discussion. Take notes and either [DM them to me](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03M1H014CX) or show the Club how to submit their own GitHub issues!
* 🌱 Sprig just got a big [UI update](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C02UN35M7LG/p1677088139279139) particularly introducing an **email-based account system** so that people will no longer lose their work in progress locally. Your feedback on this is so valuable! Particularly as club Leaders, since you're the ones running Sprig sessions.❗**NOTE: It's still in beta and code in the dev environment may be at risk!**
* 👻🛷SineRider, a game about love and math built by Hack Clubbers, just hit their beta milestone. Test the puzzles, explore the UI, and let us know what you think! [Check this post](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C01D7AHKMPF/p1677611082442109) for instructions and go to [http://sinerider.hackclub.dev/](http://sinerider.hackclub.dev/) to try it out. ❗**NOTE: Sinerider's not supported on mobile yet!**

### 🖊️ *Things* are happening
[Ella](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U01D6FYHLUW), [Leo](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U022FMN61SB) and others from the community have been working on the next big Hack Club hardware project: an accessible, [tabletop drawing machine](https://github.com/modular-things/modular-things)!

### 🤝 Help out your leader community!
It's an awesome feeling when you run a club meeting that just... works. Help other leaders feel that way too! If you've run a unique workshop in your club that went really well, or you've made slides or other resources that you're really proud of, share them in [#open-source-slides](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C04991DL23D) on Slack or send them to me to inspire and support other clubs around the world! 💖 Maybe you'll even get a surprise from me!
