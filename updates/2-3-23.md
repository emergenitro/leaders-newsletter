### 📹 AMA news

Have you seen this [AMA trailer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1J1pwGPQXY)? It's a little tast of what it's like to ask amazing people anything! Watching it got me pumped for the next one with David Malan on 2/10
If you missed the [DHH](https://dhh.dk/) AMA a couple weeks ago, [here's the recording](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dVWtWwBydB8)

### 🕵️🐴 Stable Quarters Equine Center: A Hack Club Mystery

I'm hearing from clubs around the world who are trying to crack the puzzle, but it remains unsolved! [Thomas](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U041FQB8VK2) introduced it to his club last week "... Everyone contributed toward our shared goal, solving the ARG! The excitement in the room when a discovery was made (such as when we hacked into the cameras) brought us much joy & we are going to continue working together to solve the puzzle!" and [Valerii](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U04AQ63DBHQ)'s club put up posters around school to get new people involved! 

✨Will your club be the first to crack it? **[DM me](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/D03M9GUHV1C) when you make it through!** ✨

👀 Check your 📪! We'll be sending some fliers for you to hand out or hang up wherever you want!
