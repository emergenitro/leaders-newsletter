### ❗🍕🍕 PIZZA INCOMING: Host Hack Club meetings, get pizza for your club 🍕🍕❗
What's better than coding with your friends? Eating pizza with your friends while you code! This semester, we're teaming up with GitHub to give every club [**$100 in FREE PIZZA**](https://hackclub.com/pizza/). Starting today you can apply for your pizza grant at [#pizza-party](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C05RZ6K7RS5) in Slack! 

[@Deet](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U045B4BQ2T0) and [@zsh](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U016S3C7JS2) created these [beautiful posters](https://www.figma.com/file/8RqXEeINcZqsJLGTu3fhua/Pizza-Flyer?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=z88FZF3T330ch5sz-1) that you can print and share too. If you're hosting a gathering of hackers, [dm me](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U03M1H014CX) or [@Thomas](https://hackclub.slack.com/team/U041FQB8VK2) on Slack and we can mail you a few ✨

Lastly, here's a [video](https://youtu.be/jFCrDEOPzVM?si=Dq6RBvS89vKaYfzt) created to inspire Hacker culture within your club. I'd recommend showing it in your first club meeting!

### 🏴‍☠️ Create the Hack Club flag
Hack Club is building a navy! We need your help [designing a flag](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C05MQDSPASH/p1692815465991489) to fly from the floating bouncy castle—our flagship vessel—on its deployment to [Maker Faire](https://makerfaire.com/) in October. Go to [#flag-referendum](https://hackclub.slack.com/archives/C05MQDSPASH) in Slack, submit your design, and help refine other proposals before **voting begins on September 15th**.
